# Go Ether Dream

Go language interface to the Ether Dream laser DAC. This is a work of progress and not currently in a functional state. Check back soon.

Based on the work of [j4cbo](https://github.com/j4cbo/j4cDAC/)

## Setup

This assumes you are plugged in to your ether dream via ethernet cable. You
may need allow UDP port 7654 on your firewall as you will be communicating 
on that port. Inbound fommunications are needed for the initial broadcast
signal and handshake.
